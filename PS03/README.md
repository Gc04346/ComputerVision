# Problem set 03 - Computer Vision

### By: Daniel Santana Santos - *201712040057* - Apr/2021

Python language was used in this set. Specifically for this
PS, Numpy library was used. To run the code, please run `pip install -r requirements.txt` on the
command line beforehand, at the project root directory. Then, on `main.py`, specify which formulation you would like to
execute, and which sub-problem of if. Each formulation is a class, with the name of "FormulationX", where X is the 
number of the formulation, and each sub-problem simply has the name of its number. To run the code after you have 
specified all of these, simply run `python main.py` while inside the `PS03` directory.

Special thanks to Isaque, who collaborated with me and helped me a lot in this Problem Set.
